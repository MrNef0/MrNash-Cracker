MrNash Cracker is a GUI tool for cracking MD5 & SHA-1 password hashes using wordlists (Dictionary Attack). MrNash Cracker name was inspired by my name **Naif + Hash Cracker**. This tool was my final project for object oriented programming II course. I participated with MrNash Cracker in a competitive competition for OOP II course students, and I won the second place among all other students.

# Important Notes

- To achieve the best experience, **MrNash-Cracker.jar** must be in the same directory/folder with **images** folder.
- For now, MrNash Cracker accepts only the first 1,000,000 lines of any wordlist (or less).
- Slow computers may reduce the tool speed.
